this is billo's crappy blog publishing script

Essentially:
 1. write Markdown files with a .txt extension. 
 2. Arrange them in a directory structure YYYY/MM
 3. create a CSS file header and footer shtml files
 4. enable apache server side includes to parse .shtml files
 5. run this script

Directories needed
 blogdir: this is where the .txt (Markdown) files should live
 masterdir: this is where some static boilerplate include files are

Files needed in blogdir. These are not altered by the script:
 index.shtml: this is not touched by the update script.
 header.shtml: when the script creates pages, this is the top chunk
 footer.shtml: when the script creates pages, this is the bottom chunk
 footerbar.shtml: visible contents of the footer on all pages
 monthheader.shtml: for the generated monthly index, this file is the top chunk
 monthfooter.shtml: for the generated monthly index, this file is the bottom chunk
 feed/index.shtml: the shell of the RSS feed

Files needed in masterdir:
 monthindex.shtml: This is the master template for each generated index.shtml in the month folders
 tweet.shtml: this includes the "tweet" button which is placed at the top of the archive index.

files generated by this script:
 blogdir/sidebar.shtml - this is the top level index of all the months where there is a post
 blogdir/contents.shtml = top level meat middle section of the main index file
 blogdir/feed/items.ihtml - the RSS feed items
 blogdir/YYYY/MM/contents.shtml - the contents of each month index page
 blogdir/YYYY/MM/index.shtml - the index page of each month
